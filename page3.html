        "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous and dislike men who are
        so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so
        blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that
        are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
        duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through
        shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy
        to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled
        and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every
        pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain
        circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
        business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated
        and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these
        matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure
        other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."

          account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
          explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
          rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
          but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
          encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
          anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
          because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in
          which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a

          exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any
          right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that
          has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces
